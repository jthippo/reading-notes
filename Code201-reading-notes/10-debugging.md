#### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax errors are are spelling errors in code. Hard to locate but easy to fix.
- Logic errors are where the syntax is correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. Easier to locate but harder to fix!

#### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Misspelling variables, e.g. defining _locationSales_ but occasionally writing _locationsSales_
- Putting code inside/outside the wrong set of brackets
- Sorting code in the wrong order in JS, e.g. asking code to do something with a variable which is yet to be defined

#### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript debugger allows you to:

- Watch the value of variables as they are defined and change
- Set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify problems

#### What is the call stack?

The call stack secion shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
