### HTML

#### When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

When you'd use bullet points, i.e. when the list order doesn't matter.

#### How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items? / Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

Using the CSS _list-style-type_ property, not the depreciated HTML _type_ attribute.

### CSS

#### Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

Padding and Margin are in love, even when Padding gets _really_ big. Sadly, they will never meet - they are forever kept apart by that rascal and villain, Border.

#### List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content - what goes inside the box
- Padding - distance around the Content
- Border - wrapping around the Padding
- Margin - a buffer around the Border and other page elements

### JS - I don't think we've covered any of this so far so I'll come back to it

#### What data types can you store inside of an Array?

Any! Generally we don't mix data types within an array though.

#### Is the people array below a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

_const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];_

#### List five shorthand operators for assignment in JavaScript and describe what they do.

#### Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

_let a = 10;_
_let b = 'dog';_
_let c = false;_

_// evaluate this_
_(a + c) + b;_
