### HTML links

#### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

< a > or anchor element.

#### The href attribute contains what information?

A hypertext reference or link.

#### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page; ensure links make sense out of context.
- Include keywords in link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
- Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word; use descriptive link text.

### CSS layout

#### What is meant by “normal flow”?

The default layout and behaviours for CSS elements.

#### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

A block-level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it. The size of inline-level elements is just the size of their content.

#### \_\_\_ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static positioning.

#### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

An absolutely positioned element sits on its own layer separate from everything else. It means we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page, that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page.

#### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Fixed position works in exactly the same way as absolute positioning, with one difference: absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### JS functions

#### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

Function declaration is creating a function; invocation is running or calling the function.

#### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

None, they're the same.

### Misc

#### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- Greater efficiency. I am incredibly efficiency-focussed, a key reason I left my last job was because of constant inefficiency across entire departments. I love to find the quickest, most economical, shortest, simplest etc routes to a solution.

- Learning from other people. I love to absorb knowledge and see things from other points of view. I get a sense of wellbeing from understanding something and realising, "I would NEVER have got there by myself".
