##What is growth mindset...##
to *me*?

+ Understanding we're all fluid beings who change over time
+ Information and skills have been attained before, they shall be attained again
+ **I MUST GO QUICKLY**

##STOP THIS AND TELL ME HOW TO STAY IN GROWTH MINDSET##

1. Well I inherently believe it so it's not too hard for me.
2. That said, what if I used growth mindset to believe my opinions on growth mindset could change?
3. Oh no now I'm confused.
..* I may also need a nap.
