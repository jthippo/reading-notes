### What is growth mindset... to _me_?

- Understanding we're all fluid beings who change over time.
- Information and skills have been attained before, they shall be attained again.
- At the end of [Critters (1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090887/) the little Critters turned into a giant Critter which was **great** growth mindset in my opinion.

### STOP THIS AND TELL ME HOW TO STAY IN GROWTH MINDSET

1. Well I inherently believe it so it's not too hard for me.
2. That said, what if I used growth mindset to believe my opinions on growth mindset could change?
3. ~~Oh no now I'm confused.~~
